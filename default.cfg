[output]
#format: text
#path:
candidates: 5 ; 0 or less means all sequence candidates

[input]
database: ; path to a FASTA database
add decoy: no
# enable if your DB does not have decoy sequences
# but you want to add them to the search
decoy method: reverse ; one of 'reverse' or 'random'
decoy prefix: DECOY_ ; prefix for decoy protein description

[scoring]
score: identipy.scoring.hyperscore
# this can be 'identipy.scoring.hyperscore',
# 'identipy.scoring.simple_score' or a dot-delimited
# name of a third-party function. It will be given a spectrum,
# a sequence of a candidate and config.
# score is supposed to be higher for better matches
minimum peaks: 4 ; affected by 'spectrum processor'
maximum peaks: 50 ; affected by 'spectrum processor'
# set to 0 to disable
minimum matched: 1 ; affected by 'score'
score threshold: 0 
# disregard candidates with scores below or equal to this
dynamic range: 100  ; affected by 'spectrum processor'
# disregard all peaks that are less than
# 1/x of the highest in the spectrum, where X is this value
# 0 means no filtering

[misc]
spectrum processor: e-value
# also accepted: 'minimal', or your own function
first stage:
# if you want custom refinement, put your function name here
# the function will be given the search result and expected
# to return new settings for a second search.
# The same technique is used for searching with variable mods.
