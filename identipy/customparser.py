def cleave(sequence, rule, missed_cleavages=0, min_length=None):
    """Cleaves a polypeptide sequence using a given rule.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sequence : str
        The sequence of a polypeptide.

        .. note::
            The sequence is expected to be in one-letter uppercase notation.
            Otherwise, some of the cleavage rules in :py:data:`expasy_rules`
            will not work as expected.

    rule : str or compiled regex
        A regular expression describing the site of cleavage. It is recommended
        to design the regex so that it matches only the residue whose C-terminal
        bond is to be cleaved. All additional requirements should be specified
        using `lookaround assertions
        <http://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html>`_.
        :py:data:`expasy_rules` contains cleavage rules for popular cleavage agents.
    missed_cleavages : int, optional
        Maximum number of allowed missed cleavages. Defaults to 0.
    min_length : int or None, optional
        Minimum peptide length. Defaults to :py:const:`None`.

        ..note ::
            This checks for string length, which is only correct for one-letter
            notation and not for full *modX*. Use :py:func:`length` manually if
            you know what you are doing and apply :py:func:`cleave` to *modX*
            sequences.

    Returns
    -------
    out : set
        A set of unique (!) peptides.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> cleave('AKAKBK', expasy_rules['trypsin'], 0) == {'AK', 'BK'}
    True
    >>> cleave('GKGKYKCK', expasy_rules['trypsin'], 2) == \
    {'CK', 'GKYK', 'YKCK', 'GKGK', 'GKYKCK', 'GK', 'GKGKYK', 'YK'}
    True
