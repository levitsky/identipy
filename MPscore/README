MPscore is available as a standalone script, MP.py. Requirements:
 - Python 2.7
 - numpy
 - scipy
 - matplotlib
 - pyteomics
 - pyteomics.biolccc

The pepXML, FASTA and .cfg files are required for basic operation of the script.
Cfg file contains settings for the algorithm. For some descriptors, MGF or
mzML files are needed. For quantitation through sum of matched fragment ion
intensities, an X!Tandem output XML file is needed.

Algorithm can be run with following command:

    python MP.py path_to_pepxml path_to_fasta path_to_cfg *path_to_txml *path_to_mzml *path_to_mgf.

Output contains pictures with descriptor distributions, a CSV table with
identified protein groups (only best protein from the group in terms of number
of identified peptides, at least 2 peptides) and a CSV table with identified
peptides (only best match for peptide in terms of e-value).
